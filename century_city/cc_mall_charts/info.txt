This subpackage contains code to make charts in matplotlib.

However, some of the modules provide only base chart templates as the charts had been finished 
and polished in Adobe Photoshop.

For example... assaults_2020_chart.py, assaults_2021_chart.py and assaults_2022_chart.py 
ended up being in one chart (cc_mall_assaults_2020-2022) to highlight rise of assaults in CC 
Mall in that time span.
